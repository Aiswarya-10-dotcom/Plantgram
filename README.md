### Project Description
PlantGram is a lightweight social media web app designed for plant lovers to share images and videos of their plants, interact with others by liking and commenting on posts, and manage followers/following relationships.
Key Features
User Posts:
Users can upload photos or videos of their plants with captions. Posts display on their personal home feed and also in a public feed.
Like & Comment:
Each post allows other users to like the post (with a plant-shaped like button) and add comments.
Profile Management:
Users have a profile page showing their username, avatar (first letter of username), followers, and following lists.
Followers & Following Lists:
Users can see who follows them and who they follow, with buttons to unfollow directly from these lists.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We are solving the ignorance felt by the beautiful plants. Their inability to fit in the society.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
So as we humans have instagram we thought of giving a similar fun space for plants, everyday there can be new posts from them. Every post can be liked and commented.

It demonstrates the available features in the website and how users can navigate through it. It includes home page, where we can post and we have feed where we can see others posts. Then we have profile option where we can see our own profile and search for other profiles. Then we have fun game zone, where the game says to pluck the weed, it is a timer based game. Then atlast we have a chat corner, where we can just send messages to our followers and an automated reply from them is generated there.
