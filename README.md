### Project Description
PlantGram is a lightweight social media web app designed for plant lovers to share images and videos of their plants, interact with others by liking and commenting on posts, and manage followers/following relationships.
Key Features
User Posts:
Users can upload photos or videos of their plants with captions. Posts display on their personal home feed and also in a public feed.
Like & Comment:
Each post allows other users to like the post (with a plant-shaped like button) and add comments.
Profile Management:
Users have a profile page showing their username, avatar (first letter of username), followers, and following lists.
Followers & Following Lists:
Users can see who follows them and who they follow, with buttons to unfollow directly from these lists.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We are solving the ignorance felt by the beautiful plants. Their inability to fit in the society.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
So as we humans have instagram we thought of giving a similar fun space for plants, everyday there can be new posts from them. Every post can be liked and commented.
